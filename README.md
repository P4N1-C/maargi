# maargi
Maargi is the website we developed for the Avishkaar Hackathon, designed to disperse tourists by guiding them to lesser-known destinations. By promoting the exploration of hidden gems, our initiative aims to alleviate the crowd pressure on popular sites. Through this, we strive to create a more sustainable and balanced tourism experience, benefitting both tourists and local communities.

This prototype serves as an early representation of our vision for Uttarakhand tourism. Through this initiative, we aim to highlight achievable solutions to the region's tourism challenges. By collaborating with locals, we aspire to unveil the state's underrated gems, fostering a professional network to elevate Uttarakhand's tourism industry. This prototype not only represents our vision for Uttarakhand tourism but also foreshadows upcoming features. We're developing a "Plan a Trip" feature to tailor journeys based on user preferences, budget, and trip duration, optimizing routes for an enhanced experience. Additionally, we aim to gather genuine reviews from users, ensuring authenticity and transparency in showcasing the state's hidden treasures. This collaborative approach, combining personalized trip planning and user-driven reviews, strengthens our commitment to redefining Uttarakhand's tourism landscape.

The website is currently designed exclusively for desktop use and lacks responsiveness. We acknowledge this limitation and plan to address it in future updates, ensuring a more user-friendly and accessible experience across various devices
